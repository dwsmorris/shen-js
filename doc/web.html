<h1>Deploying Shen-js repl</h1>

<p>To simply deploy Shen-js repl copy the following files/directories to some
place in your webroot:</p>

<ul>
<li>shen.js</li>
<li>shen.html</li>
<li>web/</li>
</ul>

<p>It will have its filesystem empty though. If you want to fill it with some
initial content then read the following section.</p>

<h2>Deploying synthetic filesystem</h2>

<p>Shen-js web UI tries to load (via xmlhttprequest/ajax) file <code>fs.json</code> located
in the same directory with <code>shen.html</code> which defines which files to load and
has simple structure:</p>

<pre><code>[
  {&quot;from&quot;: &quot;./relative/link&quot;, to: &quot;local/path&quot;},
  {&quot;from&quot;: &quot;http://absolute/link/...&quot;, to: &quot;local/path&quot;},
  ...
]
</code></pre>
